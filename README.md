From the most highly correlated features to the target variable we can
tell that high chest pain with a high resting heart rate is a sign that
there is potential for heart disease to occur. This is a given, but more
interestingly this dataset tells us that men are more likely to have
heart disease. However, even if you are a male with both the
symptoms higher cholesterol levels put you at a higher risk.
Exercise-induced angina puts you at a higher risk of heart disease,
but at such a low level it could be misinterpreted as a guaranteed
correlation possibly being uninvolved in a diagnosis.
